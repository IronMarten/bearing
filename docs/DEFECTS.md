# Known defects

Behaviour that is wrong today, recorded rather than fixed. Every entry names what supersedes
it, and most are pinned as tests in `KnownDefectTests` so that neither carrying one forward nor
fixing one can happen quietly.

This is also the work order for extraction. Each of these has to be fixed in `Bearing.Core`;
none is a patch to `oracle/ArchProbe`.

## Why a defect gets recorded instead of fixed

`oracle/ArchProbe` is frozen. The freeze is not a compatibility promise — nothing has shipped
that could depend on it — it is the fixed point of an in-flight refactor. Extraction moves ~997
lines of computation out of `Report.cs`, and the oracle is what separates *"I broke it"* from
*"I changed it on purpose."*

Stillness is the property it provides, not correctness. An oracle that is wrong in a known,
pinned way discharges that job perfectly. Editing it costs every fix twice, because Core is a
reimplementation rather than a port, and spends the safety net on code that is being deleted.

**The rule.** A correctness defect never justifies editing the oracle, because the oracle does
not claim to be correct. Only a defect that stops it *functioning as an oracle* does —
nondeterminism, or an inability to produce a baseline at all. Defect 6 was the one that had to
be tested against that bar; it is the only entry here that was fixed in place.

**The freeze is not absolute.** `KnownDefectTests` is the register of golden rows *expected* to
move, each naming the requirement that supersedes it. The regime is "frozen except for a
registered list of intended changes" — not "frozen".

**The probe is still the only implementation**, so the tool carries these defects until
extraction lands. That is an argument for extraction being the only thing on the agenda, not for
unfreezing.

## The register

Roughly severity-ordered. "Pinned" means `KnownDefectTests` asserts the wrong behaviour as
current, and will fail the day Core does the right thing.

### 1. Type identity is keyed on fully-qualified name alone

.NET permits the same FQN in two assemblies, and plugin architectures use it deliberately. The
two rows merge, their fan-in, fan-out, complexity and LOC are **summed**, and one type's edges
are attributed to the other's project. On nopCommerce this fabricated a five-project circular
reference — a shipping finding, wrong.

Worse than a merge: **which project is blamed is decided by load order.** Reversing the project
declaration order in `TestBed.sln` moves the row's `Project`, `File` and `Line` wholesale while
every measure stays byte-identical, and it takes the project abstractness ratio with it. So the
finding's *identity*, not just its severity, can differ between two machines analysing the same
commit.

**Half remedied.** `SubjectRef.ForType(assembly, fqn)` is the correct key and is tested — see
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4. Nothing computes with it yet; the walkers still key on name, so the defect
is live until extraction adopts it.

Pinned: `Two_types_sharing_a_name_across_assemblies_merge_into_one_row`.

### 2. Absolute gates saturate; percentile gates do not

Change cost fires on 7.9% of nopCommerce, hubs on 6.9% of Jellyfin, both truncated to 15 by
`--top`. Blast radius — the only percentile-gated finding — held at 1.0% and 0.9% across both.

Convert, do not retune. But see defect 14: converting runs *toward* a different hazard.

### 3. Truncation is never disclosed

15 of 106 shown, and nothing says so. `ARCHITECTURE.md` invariant 8.

### 4. Load success is judged by diagnostic, not outcome

All six nopCommerce "load failures" were NuGet vulnerability advisories; every project loaded. A
hard-fail rule would refuse a major .NET codebase over unrelated CVEs.

### 5. `DataAccess` classification is a hardcoded list of four ORMs

Misses LinqToDB and FluentMigrator, so nopCommerce's data layer reads as `Internal` and
layer-span goes silent rather than misfiring. Silence is the better failure of the two, which is
why it survived this long.

### 6. Visit-order dependence — **resolved**

The one defect that could have disqualified the oracle, so it was checked before phase 1 rather
than recorded.

Determinism held: six separate processes produced byte-identical output. Separate processes
matter, because .NET randomises string hashing per process and a single-process repeat proves
nothing.

But the stability was accidental. Every writer sorted on a non-total key — 257 of 261 edges tie
on `Weight` alone, 89 of 108 types on `(Cohort, MaxMemberCyclomaticXMedian)` — so most row
positions were settled by dictionary enumeration order, which is insertion order, which is
project load order. Reversing the project order in `TestBed.sln` moved all of it while leaving
the row multiset identical.

That had to be fixed in place, because Core will not reproduce the probe's incidental insertion
order however correct its numbers are, and the oracle diff would have gone red on ordering the
day Core computed anything. Total keys everywhere, `StronglyConnected` returns a canonical form,
and `OrderingTests` holds the property by re-rendering from a shuffled analysis. See
`TESTING.md` §5.

Layout — the original form of this defect, three different layouts from one dataset — remains
unfixed, but layout is in no golden and blocks nothing.

### 7. 1.4–2.0% of edges point at absent types

Including Roslyn anonymous types, which should never be graph nodes.

### 8. `.slnx` solutions do not load at all

Orchard Core could not be analysed. Cannot block extraction — TestBed is a `.sln`.

### 9. Change cost gates on `minCohort` where it means a fan-in floor

Both default to 5, so the two are indistinguishable at defaults and the defect is invisible in
the goldens. It appears only when either is tuned — which is exactly when someone is relying on
the threshold to mean what it says. Superseded by defect 2: the answer is a percentile.

Pinned: `Change_cost_is_gated_by_min_cohort_where_it_means_min_fan_in`.

### 10. The cohort floor strips a suppression it was never meant to touch

`breaksAlone` runs over all types — "no cohort required" — but reads its concealed-decision
exclusion from a list built out of the cohort-gated `eligible`. A small peer group therefore
drops a type out of concealed decision and straight into breaks alone. `RoutingDepot` is told it
breaks alone at cc 12 purely because it has three peers instead of five, and *lowering*
`--min-cohort` to 3 removes the contradiction.

Violates invariant 3 — two findings contradicting each other about one component.

Pinned: `The_cohort_floor_strips_the_concealed_decision_suppression_from_breaks_alone`.

### 11. The layer-span collapse hides the anomaly it shares a signature with

The collapse assumes a shared kind signature means a shared phenomenon. Four boilerplate
controllers and one genuine anomaly carry the identical signature, and the collapse absorbs the
anomaly — losing exactly the detail block that made it actionable.

The examples kept are ordered by fan-in and cut at four, and five of six tie at zero, so which
names survive was settled by enumeration order. Defect 6's fix made that *reproducible* — and
changed which name survives, once, as a direct result. It did not make it *right*: a tiebreak is
not a requirement.

Pinned: `The_layer_span_collapse_hides_the_anomaly_it_shares_a_signature_with`.

### 12. `WIDEST CONTRACT SURFACE` can never be suppressed, at any boundary count

The filter is `DataShape >= max(1.5 × median, 1)`, so qualifying boundaries always come from the
upper half and the set can never exceed `floor(n/2)` — precisely the number the suppression
requires it to *exceed*. It lands on the threshold at every n and never crosses. The `Take(5)`
cap is a second ceiling above ten boundaries but is not the cause; removing it changes nothing.

The only entry here that cannot be fixed by moving a constant: **a proportional gate cannot sit
on a filter proportional to the same distribution.** Needs an absolute floor or a dispersion
test, and that has to be decided before the suppression matrix is implemented in Core or it gets
reimplemented unreachable.

Pinned: `Widest_contract_surface_can_never_be_suppressed`.

### 13. `MethodMetrics.Id` is not an identifier — it is the bare method name

`SymbolDisplayFormat.FullyQualifiedFormat` qualifies *type* symbols and leaves *member* symbols
bare, so `Fq(decl)` yields `Reconcile`, `Apply`, `Post`. TestBed alone has **17 colliding groups,
one of them 12 members wide** — every `Apply` in the solution shares one Id.

Invisible until now because **nothing ever read the field**. It is written on every method and
used nowhere, so no output is wrong today and there is nothing to pin.

**It is load-bearing for the finding key.** `SubjectRef` admits a member as a subject, and
method-level concealed decision is precisely the nomination that needs one. A member subject
built on this would collide across every type sharing a method name — silently merging findings
about different components, in exactly the way defect 1 merges types. The remedy is the same
shape: `SymbolDisplayMemberOptions.IncludeContainingType`, and key a member as
`(declaring type, signature)`.

Worked around in `Report.cs` with `DeclaringTypeId` as a sort tiebreak; the field itself is left
alone for Core.

### 14. A percentile floor can be unsatisfiable, and `FanInPctl >= 95` is

`Percentile` is midrank — `100·(below + 0.5·equal)/n` — so a unique maximum tops out at
`(n-0.5)/n·100`: 90.0 at n=5, 94.44 at n=9. `BUG BLAST RADIUS` therefore **cannot fire in any
cohort of 5–9**, whatever its members look like, while `--min-cohort` admits 5.

Arithmetic, not tuning. Needs its own answer rather than falling out of defect 2's
absolute-to-percentile conversion, because that conversion runs *toward* this hazard.

Pinned: `Blast_radius_is_unreachable_in_a_cohort_below_ten`.

### 15. Breaks-alone's concealed-decision suppression is type-level only

The primary of the two concealed-decision nominations is at method level, and it is the one the
suppression cannot see — so the report says "this method is making business judgements" and "if
it breaks, it breaks alone" about one component. Invariant 3 again, by a different route than
defect 10.

The decision is closed — a method-level concealed decision *does* suppress breaks-alone on its
declaring type, and `SubjectRef` walks member → declaring type to express it. What remains is
the fix in Core.

Pinned: `A_method_level_concealed_decision_does_not_suppress_breaks_alone`.

## How these were found

Worth recording, because the methods generalise and the defects do not.

**Planting a case corrects the requirement more often than it confirms it** — three times out of
four, twice over, across the fixture plants and the suppression matrix. Making a finding fire is
how you learn whether its threshold is real. Defects 10, 11 and 12 were all found by trying to
make a suppression row fire, not by reading the code.

**Two of those were unreachable by arithmetic rather than by tuning**, which no amount of running
the tool would have revealed. That is the origin of the review question *"can this fire at all?"*
in `TESTING.md` §8.

**Using a value is how you learn whether it means what it is named.** Defect 13 was found by
reaching for `MethodMetrics.Id` as a sort key — not by the audit that was looking for exactly
this class of problem, which had passed over it because nothing read it.

**Suppressions interact through the population, not just through the code.** One suppression's
test plant had to be built from existing boundary types, because adding a new one would have
moved `boundaries.Count` and disarmed defect 12's row before it could be examined.
